WHAT's NEXT

DONE
	start working on discretizing the play-area
		r,g,b are 0-7
still to do
	discretize output space and develop interface

==========================

big-picture idea

train on ds version, play on wii(u)
the state space will be discretized
	by the average color in a vertical column of the music bar
		not sure where along the bar i need to take the average, so will compare several different x-values, although it probably wont matter : )


---------training---------
	cv - use scfh + opencv to read from desmume
	input - can step through emulation frame by frame
	output - win32api to send keystrokes.. look into fake joypad

q-learning
	see: https://github.com/chncyhn/flappybird-qlearning-bot
	and https://github.com/SarvagyaVaish/FlappyBirdRL

discretize gameplay space by incoming drums
read score / recognize mess up graphic as reinforcement
>>> will prob do first
	either do diff to find closest match to char (as in http://arnab.org/blog/so-i-suck-24-automating-card-games-using-opencv-and-python)

		- or - 
	train a Knearest model (as in https://github.com/hasegaw/IkaLog/blob/master/ikalog/utils/character_recoginizer/character.py
							and https://github.com/hasegaw/IkaLog/blob/master/ikalog/utils/character_recoginizer/number.py)

	numbers r 12x16 pixels each
	see masks folder


compare to a hand-coded recognition -> action bot as baseline?
	
----------testing----------
	cv - hdmi capture card + opencv
	output - communicate via serial to arduino as a fake classic controller (see wiibrew for pinout)

may have to move around inputs to look at different parts/ work with frameskips
hookup outputs idno
