big-picture idea

train on ds version, play on wii(u)

---------training---------
	cv - use scfh + opencv to read from desmume
	input - can step through emulation frame by frame
	output - win32api to send keystrokes.. look into fake joypad

q-learning
	see: https://github.com/chncyhn/flappybird-qlearning-bot
	and https://github.com/SarvagyaVaish/FlappyBirdRL

discretize gameplay space by incoming drums
read score / recognize mess up graphic as reinforcement
	
----------testing----------
	cv - hdmi capture card + opencv
	output - communicate via serial to arduino as a fake classic controller (see wiibrew for pinout)

may have to move around inputs to look at different parts/ work with frameskips
hookup outputs idno
